title: Concepts of Programming Languages
subtitle: Spring 2026
---

Welcome! As any other Professor you will encounter around Calvin campus, I will guarantee you that this is a life changing course. And as any other Professor around the neighnborhood, I may be exaggerating a little bit. But I can promise you that this course will open your mind to new ways of thinking about programming languages, and it will give you tools to evaluate and choose the right language for the right task.

As you might know already, we will have two different sections for this course. **Section A** will be taught by [Prof. Eric Araújo](mailto:eric.araujo@calvin.edu), a newby in this course. **Section B** will be taught by Prof. David Meyer, a veteran in this course. Both sections will cover the same material and the same assignments, but won't have the same exams.
