The many programming languages available today can be broadly categorized into two main paradigms: **declarative** and **imperative**.

## Declarative Paradigm

In the declarative paradigm, programmers express *what* the program should accomplish without explicitly specifying *how* to achieve it. This approach focuses on the desired outcome rather than the step-by-step instructions to get there. Examples of declarative languages include SQL for database queries and HTML for web page structure.

Declarative languages are known as 'high level' languages, and are more in tune with the programmer's way of thinking. They often allow for more concise and readable code, as they abstract away the underlying implementation details.

## Imperative Paradigm

In contrast, the imperative paradigm requires programmers to provide explicit instructions on *how* to perform tasks. This approach focuses on the sequence of commands that change a program's state. Examples of imperative languages include C, Java, and Python.

Imperative languages are often referred to as 'low level' languages, as they require a more detailed understanding of the computer's operations. They provide greater control over the program's execution, which can be beneficial for performance optimization and resource management.
